# RRR
React, Redux, React-Router Video Bookshelf!
## Technologies to be used:
### Required
  * Node
  * Express
  * React
  * [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  * [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
  * React-Router v4
  * Sass
  * You-Tube Api
# Instructions
  Create a basic application implementing the above technology requirements. I will allow the use of the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#getting-started) cli tool, this will allow you to focus on the building of the app and not worry about boiler plate. The application design and functionality will be a video library of sorts. I would like you to use the YouTube api to:
  1. On the home page create a search bar to poll YouTube for Videos and then display the videos in a "Card" like manner with:
      * Thumbnail
      * Title
      * Description
      * Length of the video.
  2. The user should be able to save the videos and then on the Second Page ("Saved Videos") pull the saved data and show the users saved data in the same way as the home page in the "Card" like manner again.

  Don't worry if you do not finish the full app I am just looking to see how you think and approach problems!
    #### Requirements of the application
    * CRUD your application
    * Must have at least two routes using React Router
    * Must make a call to the YouTube api using redux-thunks
    * Search Videos and add a video to your "favorites"
    * Clean UI
    * Clean Code
    * Comments on code where applicable
